## 1.0.0

No major changes since 0.7.26, but I don't anticipate any major changes in the future so might as well call it stable.

- Fixed some issues with sio2 backend, though it's still kind of broken depending on the sio2 fork/version.
- Fixed some Codeforces/AtCoder issues, maybe. Or at least I can't reproduce them now.

## 0.7.26

- Fixed bug where CSS/JS in test view and stress view sometimes wouldn't load, working around some VS Code resource loading bugs.

## 0.7.25

- Fixed WCNBA errors when submitting CodeChef optimization problems.

## 0.7.24

- Removed all mentions and links to the Discord channel.
- Removed displaying newsletter on first launch.
- Removed all telemetry and usage statistics.
- Removed automatic error reports.
- Removed manual WCNBA error reports.

## 0.7.23

- Fixed submitting to a Codeforces contest you are not registered for causing a 'website could not be analyzed' error.
- Optimized code size, which should speed up startup times.

## 0.7.22

- Added scanning ongoing CodeChef contests. They are added to the bottom of the list, because they are really long and they would clutter the view for people who don't use CodeChef.
- Added falling back to VS Code integrated terminal, if an external one can't be found or has returned an error. This also fixed some crashes when x-terminal-emulator did not exist, like on Windows.

## 0.7.21

- Added automatically hiding compilation errors after a next compilation is successful.
- Added automatically selecting code template and filename to suggestions displayed when source file is not found in stress testing.
- Added configuration option to disable all tutorial messages.
- Added message in test view reminding how to add new tests.
- Added hiding the tutorial for adding new tests after 6 successful uses.
- Added listing supported platforms for some features in error messages.

## 0.7.20

- Fixed broken user interface in test view and stress view on Windows.
- Fixed not including chrono header in default Windows code template.

## 0.7.19

- Fixed low contrast of stderr text.

## 0.7.18

- **Added modern, more clear test view user interface.**
- Added help text when adding new tests.
- Fixed configuration option descriptions being split into random lines.

## 0.7.17

- Added message about the Discord to the default code template and newsletter.
- Added documentation about resetting passwords to README. Just press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> and type "ICIE Password reset".
- Fixed AtCoder latest "website could not be analyzed" errors when submitting.

## 0.7.16

- Added official Discord channel.
- Fixed displaying dates in UTC instead of local time.
- Fixed not detecting access denied on some sio2 sites.
- Fixed not treating no languages found as a WCNBA error.

## 0.7.15

## 0.7.14

- Fixed handling IE (Internal Error) verdict at AtCoder.
- Fixed panics when trying to launch quickpasting.
- Fixed handling of weird characters in contest/task titles, which could result in EINVAL error, especially on Windows. Now, all non-alphanumeric (Unicode aware) characters are stripped from titles.

## 0.7.13

- Added manual error reports for 'website could not be analyzed' errors. If you are getting one, please press the report button and [make a bug report](https://github.com/pustaczek/icie/blob/master/docs/WEBSITE_COULD_NOT_BE_ANALYZED.md). It's really hard to debug these without any information!

## 0.7.12

- Fixed parsing example tests on Codeforces, where "Input" and "Output" headers were downloaded as test data instead of the actual test data.

## 0.7.11

- Fixed parsing some CodeChef problems failing with "missing field practice_submission_allowed".

## 0.7.10

- Added resetting credentials by selecting from a list, in addition to entering an URL.
- Fixed only detecting "C++14 (GCC 5.4.1)" and not "C++ (GCC 9.2.1)" at AtCoder.
- Fixed rare panics when executable exited too fast and closed stdin before we could write to it.

## 0.7.9

- Added links to quickpaste documentation on more kinds of quickpaste errors.
- Changed "Build" to "Compile", "Discover" to "Stress" and "Init" to "Open". This has the unfortunate effect of breaking all configuration relating to these operations, although the old values are still present in the VS Code extension .json config file.
- Removed detecting C++ template path from the pre-0.7.4 configuration entry. It's now replaced with an easier to edit entry, and can be set without going in the preferences. To do so, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> and select "ICIE Template Configure".

## 0.7.8

- Added a suggestion to run normal tests with <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>0</kbd> if brut.cpp is not found in stress tests.
- Added support for Codeforces /contests/1260 links.
- Released under a more permissive license, Mozilla Public License 2.0.

## 0.5

This version included a complete internal rewrite. There is a new event model, so the plugin now supports running multiple operations simultaneously. Also, the plugin is finally written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Thanks to that, the build system was greatly simplified and a lot of boilerplate was eliminated, which will make adding features much faster. **Expect much more stable behaviour, fewer bugs, extended configuration options and quicker development.**
